### Data

Security Sniffer manages data related to user-created security cards, each defining rules for the inclusion and exclusion of sensitive information. The primary entities in the data model are:

#### 1. Security Card

- **Attributes:**
  - `id`: Unique identifier for each security card.
  - `name`: User-defined name for the security card.
  - `description`: String describing the usage of the rules for the security card.
  - `includedPatterns`: String of rules specifying conditions for displaying certain data.
  - `excludedPatterns`: String of rules specifying conditions for hiding certain data.
  - `sensitivity`: Specific constrained selection of, 'LOW', 'MEDIUM', or 'CRITICAL'.

- **Relationships:**
  - One-to-Many with User: Each security card is associated with one user, but a user can have multiple security cards.

#### 2. User

- **Attributes:**
  - `id`: Unique identifier for each user.
  - `name`: User's chosen username.

- **Relationships:**
  - One-to-Many with Security Card: Each user can create multiple security cards, but each security card belongs to one user.

In this data model, each user can create multiple security cards, each with its own set of rules. The relationships are established through the `id` attribute, creating a one-to-many relationship between users and their security cards.

This structure allows for efficient organization and retrieval of data, ensuring that each user has a personalized set of security cards to manage their specific rules for data inclusion and exclusion.
